### UFO

# Overview of the Analysis
Our true intentions were to support Ms. Dana by providing a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings; using the date of origin with hopes to filter by city, state, country, & shape. I was able to determine more of an accurate interpretation as for how UFO sighting will be depicted in each populated jurisdiction.

# Results
Our newly coded webpage allows an individual to filter for the following criterias : date, city, state, country, and shape.

Using the attachements/steps below, this will give a good respresentation as for how this process would play out:

Step 1: Homescreen (upon opening browser link):

Step 2: Entire your desired choices into each applicable filter box: 
(*NOTE/EX. - Use a state; "ca" & a shape; "light", press enter)

Step 3: Reset filter by manually removing the information that was inputted in all filters. 

# Summary
The biggest drawback for this newly designed webpage, is that we have to input the EXACT filter option, when I am personally unaware of all of the filter options myself. It was more of a trial and error task, mainly in the "Enter shape:" field, I found that using descriptions (color, opacity) will give the best filtered outcomes. A few recommendations that I would like to implement would be:

1. Implementing a "legend" that lists the applicable options per each category/filter. This would give a great depiction as for which options would best contrast with one another.
2. Implementing an autogenerated outcome that filters the searches that are the most popular in the users given jurisdiction. 
3. Implementing a reset button for all of the filters, and for each of the filters' individually.
